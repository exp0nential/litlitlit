its lit bro
If I could, I would make a website that would pull all the schedules from a schoolwide database and show all the kids that have the same classes, free's with you.
I would have a simple user interface and you would be presented with a layout similar to nodechat. You would need a password and there would be a database with all the current students and they would have a unique login. I would set it randomly for each user but I would try to add a functionality to where students could change their own login credentials. I think that each student should be able to see what classes they have with eachother during the summer because that would make the process of changing classes much easier. I think that this would have a really positive impact on the school.
